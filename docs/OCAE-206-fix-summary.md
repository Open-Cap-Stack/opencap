# OCAE-206: Fix Permission & Role-Based Access Control Tests

## Summary of Fixes

This document summarizes the fixes made for the bug story "OCAE-206: Fix Permission & Role-Based Access Control Tests", following the Semantic Seed Venture Studio Coding Standards for test-driven development.

### Issues Fixed

1. **RBAC Middleware Enhancement**:
   - Added a role-to-permissions mapping to automatically derive permissions from roles
   - Created a `getUserPermissions` function to merge explicit and role-based permissions
   - Updated `checkPermission` to handle both explicit and role-based permissions
   - Fixed edge cases like missing permissions or unknown roles

2. **Authentication Middleware Fix**:
   - Added support for JWT tokens that already contain role and permission information
   - Implemented backward-compatible changes for existing authentication flows

3. **Test Structure Improvements**:
   - Created dedicated test utilities for RBAC testing
   - Implemented mock controllers for isolation testing
   - Structured tests following BDD best practices
   - Added edge case tests for custom permissions scenarios

### New Files Created

1. **Test Utilities**:
   - `/docs/rbac-test-fixes.md` - Technical documentation of changes
   - `/__tests__/utils/rbacTestUtils.js` - Helper functions for RBAC testing
   - `/__tests__/mocks/companyMocks.js` - Mock implementations for company controllers

### Modified Files

1. **Core Middleware**:
   - `/middleware/rbacMiddleware.js` - Enhanced with role-based permissions
   - `/middleware/authMiddleware.js` - Added support for pre-populated JWT tokens

2. **Tests**:
   - `/__tests__/middleware/rbacMiddleware.test.js` - Updated unit tests
   - `/__tests__/middleware/rbacIntegration.test.js` - Updated integration tests
   - `/__tests__/routes/companyRoutes.rbac.test.js` - Completely rewritten for isolation

### Approach

The fix followed these steps:

1. **Analysis**: Identified the root cause as a disconnect between JWT token structure and RBAC expectations
2. **Design**: Created a role-to-permissions mapping system for automatic permission resolution
3. **Implementation**: Enhanced the middleware to work with both explicit and implicit permissions
4. **Testing**: Updated tests to properly verify RBAC functionality in isolation
5. **Documentation**: Created comprehensive documentation of the changes

### Testing Strategy

1. **Unit Tests**: Verify that individual functions work as expected
2. **Integration Tests**: Verify that middleware integrates properly with Express
3. **Route Tests**: Verify that specific routes enforce the correct permissions
4. **Custom Permission Tests**: Verify that custom permissions still work correctly

All tests now pass with proper role and permission evaluation.

### Next Steps

While the RBAC tests are fixed, some global coverage thresholds aren't met yet. Additional tests for other parts of the system would be needed to meet the minimum thresholds defined in the Semantic Seed standards. These coverage issues are not directly related to the RBAC functionality and should be addressed in separate stories.
