# Model Context Protocol (MCP) Overview

## 1. Introduction

MCP (Model Context Protocol) is an **open protocol** designed to **standardize how applications provide context to LLMs**. Think of MCP like USB-C for AI applications: it standardizes how AI connects to tools and data.

### Why MCP?

- **Pre-built Integrations**: Access to growing ecosystem of tools and data sources.
- **Vendor-Agnostic**: Works across different LLM providers and platforms.
- **Security and Privacy**: Context remains in user's infrastructure.
- **Composable**: Clients can act as servers and vice versa, creating flexible multi-agent systems.

## 2. Quickstart Guides

### Server Developers
- Build your own MCP server (e.g., Weather Server)
- Expose custom tools like `get-alerts` and `get-forecast`

[Full Tutorial](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/quickstart/server)

### Client Developers
- Connect to MCP servers
- Python/Node/Java SDK usage

[Client Guide](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/quickstart/client)

### Claude Desktop
- Seamless integration with Claude for Desktop using MCP

## 3. Core MCP Concepts

### Resources
- File-like data available to LLM clients
- URI schema for consistent identification

### Tools
- Executable functions, e.g., API calls
- Method for LLMs to take actions

### Prompts
- Predefined templates for LLMs
- Reusable instruction sets

## 4. Example MCP Weather Server (Python)

```python
from mcp.server.fastmcp import FastMCP
mcp = FastMCP("weather")

@mcp.tool("get_alerts")
async def get_alerts(location: str) -> list:
    # Implementation
    return alerts

@mcp.tool("get_forecast")
async def get_forecast(location: str, days: int = 3) -> dict:
    # Implementation
    return forecast_data
```

Connect to Claude for Desktop or other MCP clients to use these tools.

## 9. Example Configurations

### Claude Desktop Configuration

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "weather": {
      "command": "uv",
      "args": ["--directory", "/ABSOLUTE/PATH/weather", "run", "weather.py"]
    }
  }
}
```

## 10. Composability: Building Effective Agents with MCP

### üîë Key Concept: Client-Server Duality

"An MCP client can be a server and vice versa."

In MCP, every component in the agent chain can operate both as a client (requesting tools/resources/prompts) and as a server (offering tools/resources/prompts). This allows multi-hop, agent-to-agent communication, and dynamic chaining of capabilities.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Architecture Diagram

```
[ User & LLM ] <---> [ Client | Server ] <---> [ Client | Server ] <---> [ Client | Server ]
```

Each component:

- Acts as a client when it needs to invoke tools/resources/prompts from another MCP server.
- Acts as a server when it provides tools/resources/prompts to other clients (including LLMs).

### üåê Use Case Example: Chained Agent Architecture

| Layer | Role |
|-------|------|
| User & LLM | Natural language interface |
| Client/Server 1 | Fetches/filters data sources |
| Client/Server 2 | Specialized tool execution |
| Client/Server 3 | Post-processing & summarization |

### üöÄ Benefits of Composability

- **Modular architecture**: Easily swap components without disrupting the whole system
- **Scalable**: Stack or chain specialized agents for complex workflows
- **Interoperable**: Agents built by different teams/organizations can interact if they adhere to MCP

### Example Flow

1. User & LLM: Requests data analysis
2. Client/Server 1: Retrieves raw data
3. Client/Server 2: Analyzes and processes data
4. Client/Server 3: Formats and summarizes for LLM response

## 11. Summary

MCP enables secure, scalable, and composable AI workflows by connecting LLMs with tools and data sources using a common protocol. Its ability to compose clients/servers dynamically makes it ideal for building agent ecosystems, LLM-powered tools, and complex AI workflows.
