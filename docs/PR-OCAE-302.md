## Story Details
**Type**: [Chore]  
**ID**: OCAE-302  
**Description**: Integrate the Shortcut API to create and manage a project backlog of epics and stories for OpenCap, following Semantic Seed Venture Studio Coding Standards.

## Implementation Details

This PR implements a complete Shortcut API integration for the OpenCap project, allowing for programmatic creation and management of the project backlog while adhering to the Semantic Seed Venture Studio Coding Standards.

### 1. Core Components Added

- **Shortcut API Client**: Created a robust JavaScript client for interacting with the Shortcut API
- **Project Standards Documentation**: Added detailed coding standards specific to OpenCap
- **Backlog Structure**: Implemented a structured approach to epics and stories with proper ID patterns (OCDI-XXX/OCAE-XXX)

### 2. Files Changed

- **Added Utilities**:
  - `/scripts/shortcut-api.js` - Core API client with functions for creating/managing epics and stories
  - `/scripts/test-shortcut-integration.js` - Test script to validate API integration
  - `/scripts/create-opencap-backlog.js` - Script to create the full OpenCap backlog structure

- **Added Documentation**:
  - `/docs/opencap-coding-standards.md` - OpenCap-specific coding standards
  - `/docs/shortcut-integration-guide.md` - Guide for using the Shortcut API with OpenCap

- **Configuration**:
  - `.env.example` - Added Shortcut API token configuration

### 3. Testing Completed

- Successfully connected to the Shortcut API using the provided token
- Created test epic and story to validate API functionality
- Generated a complete project backlog with the following structure:
  - 5 epics (Data Infrastructure, API Enhancement, Authentication & Security, Financial Reporting, Testing & Quality)
  - 32 stories with proper ID patterns and type labels
  - Detailed descriptions and acceptance criteria for all stories

## Workflow Standards Implementation

This PR implements the following Semantic Seed Venture Studio Coding Standards:

1. **Backlog Item ID Format**: 
   - OCDI-XXX for Data Infrastructure stories
   - OCAE-XXX for API Enhancement stories

2. **Story Type Labels**:
   - [Feature] - For new functionality
   - [Bug] - For bug fixes
   - [Chore] - For maintenance tasks (like this PR)

3. **Branch Naming Convention**:
   - Branch created as `chore/OCAE-302` following standards

4. **Commit Message Format**:
   - Used "OCAE-302: Integrate Shortcut API for Backlog Management"

## How to Test

1. Verify the Shortcut API integration:
   ```bash
   # Ensure .env file contains SHORTCUT_API_TOKEN
   node scripts/test-shortcut-integration.js
   ```

2. Check the full backlog in the Shortcut workspace:
   - Verify epics are correctly structured
   - Confirm stories follow naming conventions
   - Validate that all content appears as expected

## Additional Notes

- The API token is stored securely in `.env` (not committed to the repository)
- The scripts are designed to be reusable for future backlog management tasks
- The integration follows all best practices for the Shortcut API
