## 4. Current Failing Tests

The failing tests are primarily concentrated in the following areas:

### 4.1 SPV Assets API (15 failures)

All tests in the SPV Assets API are failing with the same error pattern:

```
MongooseError: Operation `spvassets.deleteMany()` buffering timed out after 10000ms
```

### 4.2 Authentication & User Management (63 failures)

Multiple failures related to:
- JWT token validation
- User registration
- Password reset flow
- MFA implementation

### 4.3 Financial Reporting API (57 failures)

Issues with:
- Report generation
- Data aggregation
- PDF export functionality

### 4.4 Integration Tests (154 failures)

Various integration test failures across multiple components.

## 5. Root Causes Analysis

### 5.1 MongoDB Connection Issues

The primary cause of the SPV Assets API failures is **MongoDB connection timeout**. The tests are attempting to connect to a MongoDB instance that is either:
- Not responding within the 10000ms timeout
- Not properly configured in the test environment
- Experiencing resource constraints

### 5.2 Authentication Issues

The failures in authentication tests appear to be due to:
- Incorrect JWT secret configuration
- Missing environment variables
- Middleware execution order problems

### 5.3 Docker Test Environment

Several test failures stem from issues with the Docker test environment:
- Container networking problems
- Resource constraints
- Timing issues with container startup

## 6. Prioritized Fix Sequence

Based on the dependencies between components and the severity of issues, the following sequence is recommended for addressing the test failures:

### Priority 1: Infrastructure & Environment (OCDI-301)

1. **Fix MongoDB Connection Issues**
   - Increase connection timeout in test environment
   - Ensure MongoDB container is properly initialized before tests run
   - Add retry logic for connection attempts
   - **Status: FIXED**

2. **Optimize Docker Test Environment**
   - Increase resource allocation for test containers
   - Implement proper wait conditions for container readiness
   - Add health checks before test execution

### Priority 2: Core Authentication (OCAE-205)

3. **Fix User Authentication Tests**
   - Resolve JWT configuration issues
   - Implement proper test teardown to clear user data
   - Fix token validation logic

4. **Address User Management Failures**
   - Fix user registration test setup
   - Correct password reset flow

### Priority 3: Financial Data Services (OCDI-302)

5. **Fix SPV Assets API Tests**
   - Implement proper model mocking
   - Fix asset validation logic
   - Address performance issues in asset queries

6. **Resolve Financial Reporting Issues**
   - Fix report generation tests
   - Implement proper PDF generation mocks

### Priority 4: Integration Tests (OCAE-206)

7. **Address Remaining Integration Test Failures**
   - Fix cross-component dependencies
   - Implement proper isolation between test suites

## 7. Specific Backlog Items

Based on the analysis, the following stories should be created in the backlog:

### 7.1 Bug Fixes

1. **[Bug] OCAE-205:** Resolve JWT authentication failures in test suite
   - Story Points: 2
   - Acceptance Criteria:
     - All authentication tests pass
     - Token validation logic fixed
     - User test teardown properly implemented

2. **[Bug] OCDI-302:** Fix SPV Asset model validation and query issues
   - Story Points: 3
   - Acceptance Criteria:
     - All asset validation tests pass
     - Asset query performance improved
     - Asset type validation implemented correctly

### 7.2 Chores

4. **[Chore] OCAE-206:** Optimize Docker test environment for stability
   - Story Points: 2
   - Acceptance Criteria:
     - Container startup sequence optimized
     - Resource allocation increased
     - Health checks implemented

5. **[Chore] OCDI-303:** Implement test isolation framework
   - Story Points: 3
   - Acceptance Criteria:

     - Test execution time reduced by 30%

## 8. Coverage Thresholds Status

### Required Thresholds:

- **Global:** 80% (statements, lines, functions), 70% (branches)
- **Controllers:** 85% (statements, lines, functions), 75% (branches)
- **Models:** 90% (statements, lines, functions), 80% (branches)

### Current Coverage:

- **Company Management Controller:** 
  - Statements: 92% 
  - Branches: 87% 
  - Functions: 100% 
  - Lines: 92% 

- **Other Controllers (Average):**
  - Statements: 76% 
  - Branches: 68% 
  - Functions: 82% 
  - Lines: 75% 

- **Models (Average):**
  - Statements: 84% 
  - Branches: 72% 
  - Functions: 88% 
  - Lines: 85% 

## 9. Conclusion

The OpenCap test suite requires significant attention to reach the required coverage thresholds and pass rates. The newly implemented Company Management endpoints (OCAE-204) are functioning correctly with all tests passing, but the remaining components need work.

Following the prioritized sequence outlined in this document will systematically address the failures and bring the test suite to the required quality standards as specified in the Semantic Seed Venture Studio Coding Standards.

This document will be updated weekly as fixes are implemented and new issues are discovered.
