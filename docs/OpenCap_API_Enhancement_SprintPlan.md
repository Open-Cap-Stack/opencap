## Current API Status

### Core APIs (Fully Implemented)
The following APIs are fully implemented with documentation and tests:

- **User API** (`/api/users`)
  - User management and authentication
  - Profile information

- **Stakeholder API** (`/api/stakeholders`)
  - Stakeholder management
  - Relationship tracking

- **Document API** (`/api/documents`)
  - Document storage and retrieval
  - Version control

### Optional/Partially Implemented APIs
The following APIs are registered in the app.js file but use `safeRequire` which means they might not be available in all environments or might be partially implemented:

- **Communication API** (`/api/communications`)
  - Messaging functionality
  - Communication history

- **Notification API** (`/api/notifications`)
  - User notification management
  - Notification preferences

- **Invite Management API** (`/api/invites`)
  - User invitation system
  - Invitation tracking and management

- **SPV API** (`/api/spv`)
  - Special Purpose Vehicle management
  - Investment vehicle structuring

- **SPV Asset API** (`/api/spv-assets`)
  - Assets within SPVs
  - Asset allocation and tracking

- **Compliance Check API** (`/api/compliance-checks`)
  - Regulatory compliance verification
  - Compliance history tracking

- **Integration Module API** (`/api/integration-modules`)
  - Third-party service integration
  - API connectors management

- **Tax Calculator API** (`/api/taxCalculations`)
  - Tax estimation tools
  - Tax calculation history

## Missing API Endpoints

Despite being listed in the app.js file with `safeRequire`, the following APIs need proper implementation or enhancement to ensure they are fully functional:

1. **Data Pipeline APIs**
   - MinIO Storage Operations (not implemented)
   - Data Processing Pipelines (partially implemented)

2. **Real-time Analytics APIs**
   - Dashboard Metrics (not implemented)
   - Time-series Data (not implemented)

## Implementation Approach

All API implementations will follow the SSCS workflow:

1. **Create Feature Branch**:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/OCAE-XXX
   ```

2. **Write Failing Tests (Red Tests)**:
   ```bash
   # Write tests first
   git commit -m "WIP: OCAE-XXX: Red tests for feature description"
   ```

3. **Implement Code (Green Tests)**:
   ```bash
   # Make tests pass
   git commit -m "WIP: OCAE-XXX: Green tests for feature description"
   ```

4. **Refactor and Finalize**:
   ```bash
   # Clean up code
   git commit -m "OCAE-XXX: Implement feature description"
   ```

5. **Pull Request Process**:
   - Create PR with story ID in title
   - Include story details in description
   - Mark story as "Finished" in Shortcut

## Testing Strategy

Each API will have the following test coverage:

1. **Unit Tests**:
   - Model validation
   - Controller logic
   - Error handling

2. **Integration Tests**:
   - API endpoint functionality
   - Cross-API interactions
   - Database operations

3. **Performance Tests**:
   - Load testing for high-traffic endpoints
   - Response time benchmarks
   - Resource utilization

4. **Security Tests**:
   - Authentication and authorization
   - Input validation
   - Protection against common vulnerabilities

## Documentation Requirements

All API endpoints must be documented with:

1. **Endpoint Description**: Clear explanation of purpose
2. **Request Parameters**: Required and optional parameters
3. **Response Format**: Expected response structure
4. **Example Requests/Responses**: Practical examples
5. **Error Handling**: Possible error codes and meanings

## Conclusion

This sprint plan provides a structured approach to enhancing the OpenCap platform's APIs, ensuring that all critical functionality is implemented with proper testing and documentation. By following the SSCS workflow, we'll maintain consistency and traceability throughout the development process.
