# OpenCap API Enhancement Sprint Plan
# Detailed Implementation Roadmap

**Version**: 1.1  
**Date**: March 23, 2025  
**Author**: Development Team  
**Status**: Active - Sprint 1 Completed

## Overview

This document outlines the sprint plan for enhancing the OpenCap platform's APIs, focusing on implementing and improving APIs that are critical for the platform's functionality. The plan follows the Semantic Seed Venture Studio Coding Standards (SSCS) to ensure consistent tracking, proper workflow in Shortcut, and alignment with the project's branching strategy.

This is a 10-week (5 sprint) implementation timeline for enhancing the OpenCap API layer, ensuring all functional code has properly exposed endpoints and resolving duplicate/inconsistent implementations. The plan implements Test-Driven Development (TDD) and Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) throughout.

## Sprint Goals

The primary goals of this API enhancement initiative are:
