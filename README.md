## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project on your local machine:

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- MongoDB

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
cd your-repository
```

### Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### Set Up Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root of the project and add the following environment variables:

```plaintext
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/open-cap-stack
PORT=5000
```

Replace `mongodb://localhost:27017/open-cap-stack` with your MongoDB connection string if it's different.

## Running the Project

### Start the Development Server

```bash
npm start
```

This command starts the server on `http://localhost:5000`.

### Start the Development Server with Nodemon

For automatic restarts on code changes, use:

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Running Tests

The project uses Jest for testing. To run the tests, use the following command:

```bash
npm test
```

This command runs all the test cases defined in the `tests` directory.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Please fork the repository and submit a pull request for any changes. This project follows a Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach, and all contributions should adhere to this coding style.

### Guidelines for Contributing

1. **Fork the repository**:
   ```bash
   git fork https://github.com/Open-Cap-Stack/opencap.git
   ```
2. **Create a new branch**:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature-branch
   ```
3. **Write tests first**:
   - Ensure you write test cases for any new functionality or changes before writing the actual code.
   - Place your tests in the `tests` directory.
4. **Implement the functionality**:
   - Write the minimum amount of code required to pass the tests.
5. **Run tests**:
   ```bash
   npm test
   ```
   - Ensure all tests pass before committing your changes.
6. **Commit your changes**:
   ```bash
   git commit -am 'Add new feature'
   ```
7. **Push to your branch**:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature-branch
   ```
8. **Create a Pull Request**:
   - Go to the repository on GitHub and create a pull request from your branch.

## Submitting Changes

Follow these steps to submit your code changes:

1. **Create a new branch:**
   ```sh
   git checkout -b feature/{story-id}  # For features
   git checkout -b bug/{story-id}      # For bugs
   git checkout -b chore/{story-id}    # For chores
   ```

2. **Make your changes:**
   Ensure your code follows the coding standards (see below).

3. **Write failing tests:**
   Write tests that demonstrate the functionality is NOT already present. Make a WIP commit:
   ```sh
   git add .
   git commit -m "WIP: Red Tests."
   ```

4. **Implement code to pass the tests:**
   Make WIP commits as you go, and commit code when your tests are green:
   ```sh
   git add .
   git commit -m "WIP: Green Tests."
   ```

5. **Refactor your code:**
   Refactor to improve code quality. Re-run the tests and commit:
   ```sh
   git add .
   git commit -m "Refactor complete."
   ```

6. **Submit a pull request:**
   ```sh
   git push origin feature/{story-id}  # Push your branch
   ```

   Go to the repository on GitHub and create a pull request from your branch to the `main` branch.

7. **Review process:**
   Review outstanding pull requests, comment on, approve and merge open pull requests, or request changes on any PRs that need improvement.

## Coding Standards

Please follow these coding standards to maintain code quality and consistency:

1. **Indentation:**
   Use 4 spaces for indentation.

2. **Naming Conventions:**
   - Variables and functions: camelCase
   - Classes and components: PascalCase
   - Constants: UPPERCASE_SNAKE_CASE

3. **Comments:**
   - Use JSDoc style comments for functions and classes.
   - Provide meaningful comments for complex code segments and functions.
   - Document any public APIs and classes with clear explanations of their purpose and usage.
   - Remove or update outdated comments as code changes.

4. **Code Structure:**
   - Organize code into modules and components.
   - Keep functions small and focused on a single task.

5. **Linting:**
   Ensure your code passes ESLint checks:
   ```sh
   npm run lint
   ```

6. **Testing:**
   - Write unit tests using BDD-style frameworks like Mocha or Jasmine.
   - Follow the Arrange, Act, and Assert (AAA) pattern:
     ```javascript
     it('should correctly add two positive numbers', () => {
       // Arrange
       const num1 = 5;
       const num2 = 7;

       // Act
       const result = add(num1, num2);

       // Assert
       expect(result).to.equal(12);
     });
     ```

   - Write integration tests to validate interactions between different parts of the application.
   - Write functional tests to validate the application's functionality.
