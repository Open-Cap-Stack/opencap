## Contributing 🤝

Contributions are welcome! Please fork the repository and submit a pull request for any changes. This project follows a Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach, and all contributions should adhere to this coding style.

### Guidelines for Contributing 📝

1. **Fork the repository**:

    ```bash
    git fork https://github.com/Open-Cap-Stack/opencap.git
    ```

2. **Create a new branch**:

    ```bash
    git checkout -b feature-branch
    ```

3. **Write tests first**:
    - Ensure you write test cases for any new functionality or changes before writing the actual code.
    - Place your tests in the `tests` directory.

4. **Implement the functionality**:
    - Write the minimum amount of code required to pass the tests.

5. **Run tests**:

    ```bash
    npm test
    ```

    - Ensure all tests pass before committing your changes.

6. **Commit your changes**:

    ```bash
    git commit -am 'Add new feature'
    ```

7. **Push to your branch**:

    ```bash
    git push origin feature-branch
    ```

8. **Create a Pull Request**:
    - Go to the repository on GitHub and create a pull request from your branch.

## Submitting Changes 🚀

Follow these steps to submit your code changes:

1. **Create a new branch**:

    ```bash
    git checkout -b feature/{story-id}  # For features
    git checkout -b bug/{story-id}      # For bugs
    git checkout -b chore/{story-id}    # For chores
    ```

2. **Make your changes**:
    - Ensure your code follows the coding standards (see below).

3. **Write failing tests**:
    - Write tests that demonstrate the functionality is NOT already present.
    - Make a WIP commit:

    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "WIP: Red Tests."
    ```

4. **Implement code to pass the tests**:
    - Make WIP commits as you go, and commit code when your tests are green:

    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "WIP: Green Tests."
    ```

5. **Refactor your code**:
    - Refactor to improve code quality. Re-run the tests and commit:

    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "Refactor complete."
    ```

6. **Submit a pull request**:

    ```bash
    git push origin feature/{story-id}  # Push your branch
    ```

    - Go to the repository on GitHub and create a pull request from your branch to the main branch.

7. **Review process**:
    - Review outstanding pull requests, comment on, approve and merge open pull requests, or request changes on any PRs that need improvement.

## Coding Standards 🎨

Please follow these coding standards to maintain code quality and consistency:

- **Indentation**: Use 4 spaces for indentation.

- **Naming Conventions**:
  - Variables and functions: camelCase
  - Classes and components: PascalCase
  - Constants: UPPERCASE_SNAKE_CASE

- **Comments**:
  - Use JSDoc style comments for functions and classes.
  -

 Provide meaningful comments for complex code segments and functions.
  - Document any public APIs and classes with clear explanations of their purpose and usage.
  - Remove or update outdated comments as code changes.

- **Code Structure**:
  - Organize code into modules and components.
  - Keep functions small and focused on a single task.

- **Linting**: Ensure your code passes ESLint checks:

    ```bash
    npm run lint
    ```

- **Testing**:
  - Write unit tests using BDD-style frameworks like Mocha or Jasmine.
  - Follow the Arrange, Act, and Assert (AAA) pattern:

    ```javascript
    it('should correctly add two positive numbers', () => {
      // Arrange
      const num1 = 5;
      const num2 = 7;

      // Act
      const result = add(num1, num2);

      // Assert
      expect(result).to.equal(12);
    });
    ```

  - Write integration tests to validate interactions between different parts of the application.
  - Write functional tests to validate the application's functionality.
