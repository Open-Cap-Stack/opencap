# OpenCap Stack 🚀

**OpenCap Stack** is a comprehensive MERN stack application designed to manage stakeholders, share classes, documents, activities, notifications, equity simulations, tax calculations, and financial reporting. The project follows a Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach to ensure code quality and reliability and is fully aligned with the Open Cap Table Alliance (OCTA) schema.

## Development Workflow 📝

This project follows the Semantic Seed Venture Studio Coding Standards (SSCS) which emphasizes:

- **Structured Backlog Management** with proper story IDs (OCAE-XXX, OCDI-XXX format)
- **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** with Red-Green-Refactor cycle
- **Consistent Branch Naming** (`feature/OCAE-XXX`, `bug/OCAE-XXX`, `chore/OCAE-XXX`)
- **Daily Commits** with proper prefixes (including "WIP:" for work in progress)
- **Pull Request Process** that maintains traceability to backlog items

For detailed workflow guidelines, see [SSCS_Workflow_Guide.md](docs/SSCS_Workflow_Guide.md).

## Installation 🛠️

Follow these steps to set up the project on your local machine:

### Prerequisites ✅

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- MongoDB
- Docker and Docker Compose (for containerized development)
- Git

### Clone the Repository 📂

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Open-Cap-Stack/opencap.git
cd opencap
```

### Install Dependencies 📦

```bash
npm install
```

### Set Up Environment Variables 🔐

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following:

```bash
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://mongo:27017/opencap
PORT=5000
```

Replace `mongodb://mongo:27017/opencap` with your MongoDB connection string if it's different.

## Running the Project ▶️

### Start the Development Server 🌐

```bash
npm start
```

This command starts the server on [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000).

### Start the Development Server 🔄

For automatic restarts on code changes, use:

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Running with Docker 🐳

For a containerized development environment:

```bash
# Build and start all services
docker-compose up -d

# View logs
docker-compose logs -f

# Stop all services
docker-compose down
```

### Running Tests with Docker 🧪

```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.test.yml up --build
```

This will run all tests in a containerized environment, ensuring consistent test results across different development machines.

## Running Tests 🧪

The project uses Jest for testing. To run the tests, use the following command:

```bash
npm test
```

This command runs all the test cases defined in the `tests` directory.

### Code Coverage

We measure test coverage locally for development purposes only:

```bash
npm run test:coverage
```

**Important Note**: We do NOT integrate with Codecov or any other third-party coverage service. All coverage reporting should be performed locally and documented in pull requests when relevant.

## CI/CD Pipeline 🔄

Our continuous integration and deployment pipeline focuses on:

1. **Docker Hub**: For container image storage and versioning
2. **Digital Ocean**: For deployment and hosting

### Required GitHub Secrets

The following secrets are required for our CI/CD pipeline:
- `DOCKERHUB_USERNAME`
- `DOCKERHUB_TOKEN`
- `DIGITALOCEAN_ACCESS_TOKEN`

### Deployment

We follow the deployment plan outlined in [OpenCap_TestCoverage_DigitalOceanDeployment.md](docs/OpenCap_TestCoverage_DigitalOceanDeployment.md).

## Resource Management Best Practices 🔧

To maintain codebase integrity and avoid conflicts:

1. **Verify Existing Docker Resources**:
   ```bash
   docker ps -a        # Check existing containers
   docker volume ls    # Check existing volumes
   ```

2. **Check Existing Files and Directories**:
   ```bash
   ls -la [directory]  # List directory contents
   find . -name "pattern"  # Find files matching pattern
   ```

3. **Review Configurations**: Always check current configuration before making changes
4. **Database Schema Changes**: Analyze existing schemas before modifications

These practices prevent duplication, conflicts, and ensure proper integration with the existing codebase.

    git checkout -b bug/OCAE-XXX      # For bug fixes
    git checkout -b chore/OCAE-XXX    # For maintenance tasks
    ```

3. **Write tests first (Red Tests)**:
    - Write tests that demonstrate the functionality is NOT already present.
    - Make a WIP commit:

    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "WIP: OCAE-XXX: Red Tests for feature description"
    ```

4. **Implement code to pass the tests (Green Tests)**:
    - Write the minimum amount of code required to pass the tests.
    - Make a WIP commit when tests pass:

    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "WIP: OCAE-XXX: Green Tests for feature description"
    ```

5. **Refactor your code**:
    - Refactor to improve code quality without changing functionality.
    - Re-run the tests and commit with a final message:

    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "OCAE-XXX: Implement feature description"
    ```

6. **Push your branch and create a pull request**:

    ```bash
    git push origin feature/OCAE-XXX
    ```

    - Create a PR on GitHub with the story ID in the title.
    - Include story details in the description.
    - Mark the story as "Finished" in Shortcut.

7. **Daily Commits Required**:
    - Even for incomplete work, commit daily with "WIP:" prefix.
    - This ensures visibility and allows for collaboration.

## Coding Standards 🎨

Please follow these coding standards to maintain code quality and consistency:

- **Indentation**: Use 4 spaces for indentation.

- **Naming Conventions**:
  - Variables and functions: camelCase
  - Classes and components: PascalCase
  - Constants: UPPERCASE_SNAKE_CASE

- **Comments**:
  - Use JSDoc style comments for functions and classes.
  -

 Provide meaningful comments for complex code segments and functions.

- Document any public APIs and classes with clear explanations of their purpose and usage.
- Remove or update outdated comments as code changes.

- **Code Structure**:

    ```bash
    npm run lint
    ```

- **Testing**:
  - Write unit tests using BDD-style frameworks like Mocha or Jasmine.
  - Follow the Arrange, Act, and Assert (AAA) pattern:

    ```javascript
    it('should correctly add two positive numbers', () => {
      // Arrange
      const num1 = 5;
      const num2 = 7;

      // Act
      const result = add(num1, num2);

      // Assert
      expect(result).to.equal(12);
    });
    ```

  - Write integration tests to validate interactions between different parts of the application.
