# Security Audit Failures

## Overview

The weekly security audit has detected critical or high severity security vulnerabilities that require immediate attention.

## Details

Please check the [Security Audit workflow run]({{ github.server_url }}/{{ github.repository }}/actions/runs/{{ github.run_id }}) for detailed reports.

The security report has been uploaded as an artifact and contains information about:
- Vulnerable dependencies
- Recommended fixes
- Impact assessment
- Test coverage for security-critical paths

## Action Required

1. Download and review the security audit report from the workflow artifacts
2. Address all critical and high severity vulnerabilities as soon as possible
3. Run `npm run security:fix` to automatically fix issues where possible
4. For issues that cannot be automatically fixed, follow the recommendations in the report
5. Ensure all fixes are accompanied by appropriate tests
6. Verify fixes by running `npm run security:audit` locally before committing

## Security Requirements

According to the Semantic Seed Venture Studio Coding Standards V2.0, all security vulnerabilities must be addressed following proper TDD workflow:
- Write tests to demonstrate the vulnerability
- Fix the vulnerability
- Verify the tests pass
- Document the fix

Remember that all work on security issues must follow our [security policy](../docs/dependency-security-plan.md).

**DO NOT commit credentials, API keys, or other sensitive information to the repository.**

## Timeline

- **Critical vulnerabilities**: Must be addressed within 24 hours
- **High vulnerabilities**: Must be addressed within 3 business days
- **Medium/Low vulnerabilities**: Schedule for next sprint
